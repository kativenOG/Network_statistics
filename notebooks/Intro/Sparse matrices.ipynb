It ensures that such large matrices can still be stored into memory without causing errors.

    "As expected, running this code is not difficult. There is nothing big going on. However, try changing the value of $n$ to e.g. $n = 1000000$, and you will see an interesting error pop up. Apparently, a huge amount of RAM is being using to store such a trivial matrix. What is going wrong here? In essence, Python is trying to allocate a piece of memory for every entry of the matrix; even the zeros. We call this **full-format** storage of the matrix. Full-format storage wastes a lot of space to zeros, causing the memory to be completely flooded. The idea of sparse matrix representation is to only store non-zero values. In case of our trivial matrix, this will reduce memory allocation significantly."
